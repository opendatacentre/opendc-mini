# Open Datacenter Mini

---

Open Datacentre Mini, aka **opendc-mini**, teaches how to build the components of a CI/CD platform using [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and [Helm](https://helm.sh).  This is not your usual course.  Instead it is more of an experiment into creating a living course that can improve and expand over time.

The Gitbook that is created from this repo is available [here](https://www.gitbook.com/book/open-datacentre/open-datacentre-mini/details).
